# VPS Rotation Strategy for Twitter Scraping

## Option 1: Multiple VPS with Round-Robin
- Rent 2-3 VPS from different providers/regions
- Rotate requests between them (e.g., VPS1 → VPS2 → VPS3 → VPS1)
- Each VPS uses different IP ranges

## Option 2: VPS + Proxy Rotation
- Single VPS with rotating proxy service
- More cost-effective than multiple VPS
- Easier to manage

## Option 3: Cloud Functions
- Use serverless functions (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions)
- Each execution gets a potentially different IP
- Pay-per-use model

## Implementation Ideas:

### A. Simple VPS Rotation
```python
vps_endpoints = [
    "http://vps1.yourdomain.com:8080",
    "http://vps2.yourdomain.com:8080", 
    "http://vps3.yourdomain.com:8080"
]

current_vps = 0
def get_next_vps():
    global current_vps
    endpoint = vps_endpoints[current_vps]
    current_vps = (current_vps + 1) % len(vps_endpoints)
    return endpoint
```

### B. Health Check Integration
- Monitor each VPS for blocks
- Skip blocked IPs automatically
- Add cooldown periods for blocked IPs
