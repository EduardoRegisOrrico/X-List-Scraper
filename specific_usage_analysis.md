# 50GB Traffic Analysis for Your Twitter Scraper

## BASED ON YOUR ACTUAL LOGS:

From your debug logs, I can see:
- You were checking every 2 seconds initially
- Got rate limited quickly (only ~60 successful requests in 10+ hours)
- With proxies, you'd likely get much better success rates

## REALISTIC PROJECTIONS:

### Current Pattern (Every 2 seconds when working):
- **Without Rate Limits**: 1,800 requests/hour = 43,200/day
- **With Rate Limits**: ~10-20 successful requests/hour
- **With Good Proxies**: ~100-300 successful requests/hour

### Traffic Breakdown:
```
Scenario 1: Conservative (100 successful/hour)
- 100 requests/hour × 24 hours = 2,400 requests/day  
- 2,400 × 2.5MB = 6GB/day = 180GB/month
- 50GB would last ~8 days ❌

Scenario 2: Rate Limited (20 successful/hour) 
- 20 requests/hour × 24 hours = 480 requests/day
- 480 × 2.5MB = 1.2GB/day = 36GB/month  
- 50GB would last ~42 days ✅

Scenario 3: Your Current Reality (~10 successful/hour)
- 240 requests/day = 0.6GB/day = 18GB/month
- 50GB would last ~85 days ✅✅
```

## RECOMMENDATION:

**50GB IS ENOUGH** for your current use case because:

1. **✅ Rate Limiting Reality**: Even with proxies, Twitter will limit you
2. **✅ Your Pattern**: Monitoring 1 specific list, not mass scraping  
3. **✅ Safety Buffer**: 50GB gives you 2-3x headroom
4. **✅ Cost Effective**: Better to start small and upgrade if needed

### If You Need More Later:
- Most providers allow mid-month upgrades
- You can monitor usage in real-time
- Upgrade to 100GB or unlimited if you scale up

### Traffic Monitoring:
```python
# Add this to track your usage
import time
total_traffic = 0

def log_request_size(response):
    global total_traffic
    size_mb = len(response.content) / (1024*1024)
    total_traffic += size_mb
    print(f"Request: {size_mb:.2f}MB, Total: {total_traffic:.1f}MB")
```
